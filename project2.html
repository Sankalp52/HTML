                August 7, 2024, marks the stunning debut of the new Tata Curvv, India’s first SUV Coupé packed with disruptive innovations to maximise user comfort. The car combines the toughness and practicality inherent in SUVs with the elegance and sportiness of coupés to create a product that offers better fuel efficiency, sportier handling and more cargo space.

With the creation of the Tata Curvv, Tata Motors, India’s leading automotive manufacturer with a rich history of firsts in the field of automobile design, has once again pushed the boundaries of what a car can be.

Speaking at the unveiling, Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd., and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd., said, “Tata Motors has pioneered the Indian SUVarena. What’s more is that we have repeatedly disrupted the category though innovative designs that deliver great road presence as well as enhanced functionality. The original Sierra, Safari, Nexon, Punch and Harrier are testament to this design led market leadership in SUVs. Taking this legacy forward and to further strengthen our SUV portfolio, we have once again broken the clutter in the effervescent and aspirational mid SUV category by introducing the Tata Curvv – India’s first SUV Coupé – a disruptive design which democratizes the Coupé body style in the premium categories, providing best in segment performance and never before seen practicality.”
